Born and raised in Southern California and continues to live in Southern California.

I am currently an analyst at a money whire transfer company in Buena Park, CA. When possible, I will use python to complete projects at work. I find Python easier to use and better able to handle large amounts of data than Excel (my opinion).

I primarily use Python during kaggle competitions. I get to focus on projects and subjects that interest me. It also provides a lot of practice. Data Science classes also give us additional projects that we must work on. Overall, I spend the majority of my day working on one or two Data Science project.

I love Python and Data Science and the challenges it brings. I enjoy solving everyday problems and providing valuable information to those that need it.
