## About

Born and raised in Southern California and continues to live in Southern California. 

I have a BA in Psychology and a MA in Forensic Psychology. I have taken additional courses in crime analysis. I began learning Python approximetly two years ago. I do get to use it sometimes at work (we use only excel), but I primarily use it during kaggle competitions. Data Science classes also give us additional competition. 

I love Python and Data Science and the challenges it brings. I enjoy solving everyday problems with python. It defintely keeps you on your toes.
