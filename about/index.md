Born and raised in Southern California and continues to live in Southern California.

I have a BA in Psychology and a MA in Forensic Psychology. I have taken additional courses in crime analysis. I began learning Python approximetly two years ago.

I do get to use Python sometimes at work when excel isn't sufficient for me or co-workers. I am currently looking for a more suitible position where I am better ablt to use my skills.

but I primarily use it during kaggle competitions. Data Science classes also give us additional competition.

I love Python and Data Science and the challenges it brings. I enjoy solving everyday problems with python. It defintely keeps you on your toes.
