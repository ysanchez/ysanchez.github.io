This was a kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

## Data

I split this project into two different parts. The first part was cleaning up the data and engineering some columns in the data given.
Advanced-Regression---Kaggle/data advanced regression final.ipynb

## Algorithm

I tried a mulitude of algorithms to find the best one. In the Metrics explanation .."Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)." This means that the algorithm being used should be linear.
